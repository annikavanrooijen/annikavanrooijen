# Welcome to My GitHub Profile 👩🏻‍⚕️

Hello there! I'm Annika - A nurse with six years of practical experience in clinical and home care settings. 
My journey in healthcare has been incredibly fulfilling, but the beginning of the year, I decided to quit my job as a nursing specialist to promote the digital transformation of the health care sector in Germany.
I'm excited to share my journey into the world of data science and technology to revolutionize the health care of tomorrow. 

## About Me

👩🏻‍⚕️ My clinical expertise has honed my problem-solving skills and taught me the value of data and technology to improve patient outcomes.

👩🏻‍🎓 Recently, I took a leap into data science by doing Data Science Bootcamp SPICED ACADEMY. In this 12 weeks experience I aquired knowledge in Python, data visualization, machine learning, deeplearning and other relevant technologies. 

🎯 My mission is to leverage data-driven solutions and emerging technologies to shape the future of healthcare positively. By combining my clinical insights with cutting-edge data science techniques, I aim to create innovative solutions that enhance patient care, optimize medical processes, and improve overall healthcare delivery.

🚀 The Bootcamp was just the start for me: currently I am studying Computer Science in Culture and Health @ HTW Berlin.

## What to Expect from My Repositories

In this GitHub space, you'll find a collection of the projects I woked on during Bootcamp and the Programming I am doing in my studys.
