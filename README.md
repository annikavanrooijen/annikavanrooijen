# Welcome to My GitHub Profile 👩🏻‍⚕️

Hello there! I'm Annika - A nurse with six years of practical experience in clinical and home care settings. 
My journey in healthcare has been incredibly fulfilling, but the beginning of the year, I decided to quit my job as a nursing specialist to promote the digital transformation of the health care sector in Germany.
I'm excited to share my journey into the world of data science and technology to revolutionize the health care of tomorrow. 

## About Me

👩🏻‍⚕️ My clinical expertise has honed my problem-solving skills and taught me the value of data and technology to improve patient outcomes.

👩🏻‍🎓 Recently, I took a leap into data science by doing Data Science Bootcamp SPICED ACADEMY. In this 12 weeks experience I aquired knowledge in Python, data visualization, machine learning, deeplearning and other relevant technologies. 

🎯 My mission is to leverage data-driven solutions and emerging technologies to shape the future of healthcare positively. By combining my clinical insights with cutting-edge data science techniques, I aim to create innovative solutions that enhance patient care, optimize medical processes, and improve overall healthcare delivery.

🚀 The Bootcamp was just the start for me: my next step is to study Computer Science

## My Interests

- I am a cat-mom of two, nature loving, spontanious and always up for an adventure
- I love exploring the world, meeting people, learning about new cultures - and of corse food
- I really enjoy Yoga and long hikes in the Alps 

## What to Expect from My Repositories

In this GitHub space, you'll find a collection of the projects I woked on during Bootcamp. I am currently polishing the code and uploading the code bit by bit.

Feel free to explore, collaborate, or provide feedback. I'm always open to learning and growing in this field!
